                        As part of a team, working for one of the largest players in the <b>telecom</b> industry I built a short message
                        routing system capable of handling hundreds of thousands of messages per second between different endpoints including landline communication,
                        fax communication, mobile communication and email. Besides routing, the project involved 
                        temporary caching of the messages due to business requirements. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additionally, I was in charge of building
                        an overview maintenance application that allowed remote server configuration, health checks and a performance
                        dashboard using <a href="https://vaadin.com/"><b>Vaadin</b></a>.

                    <li>
                        In this project, Hibernate played a crucial role because the application involved complex data models. 
                        I leveraged Hibernate’s ORM to ensure database synchronisation and improved performance through caching.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I built a custom database solution using <b>MySQL</b> with <b>InnoDB</b> as storage engine. While architecting this
                        project, I made decisions regarding the proper <b>indexing</b> to be used together with developing a system 
                        that enabled team members to build <b>complex queries</b> over the dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As Hibernate's internal connection pool solution was not suitable for production, I configured
                        and managed MySQL connections using <a href="https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0"><b>c3p0</b></a> in order to improve the performance and throughput.

                        During a project for one of the most important clients in the energy industry I built a data analysis
                        solution based on <b>logistical regression</b>. I also deployed this on amazon infrastructure using 
                        <b>AWS Lambda</b> and Spring Cloud.

                        for this security critical architecture and produced an <b>Angular 6</b> application stylized using <b>Bootstrap</b>

                        I developed an internal tool for one of our largest clients in the industry which involved statistical
                        analysis over their data. I leveraged <b>Mongo</b>'s document oriented architecture and flexible aggregation pipeline 
                        to extract meaningful information and visualise them in a client build with <b>AngularJS</b>.

                I started working on a <a href="https://github.com/overstained/Randomeet">match-making chat application</a> that
                paired users based on a complex profile of personality(scored using MBTI test), general knowledge(trivia questions)
                and IQ tests(using the previous progressive raven matrix generator project).
                The communication between paired users was <b>p2p</b> powered by <a href="https://webrtc.org/">webrtc</a> which allowed both text as well as webcam streaming.
                For this project I used AngularJS framework to build the client, exposed a NodeJS API with MongoDB persistence and a signaling server
                based on <b>websockets</b>.

                Developed a <a href="https://github.com/overstained/plotly4j">chart plotting library</a> for Java, by applying the plotly.js library inside a <b>JavaFX</b> webview container.
                I accomplished a bidirectional interaction between Java and Javascript with the <b>Nashorn</a> engine.

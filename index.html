                    Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.
                    The University left me with valuable skills, both theoretical and practical.
                    Besides learning important subjects such as OOP, <b>Algorithms</b> or Project Management,
                    I also had the opportunity to be involved in research, in <b>Proof Mining and Combinatorial Optimization</b>.

                    In collaboration with two mathematical teachers within the University, we wrote and published
                    an article about effective applications of proof mining in order to extract hidden quantitative
                    results from mathematical proofs.

                    As framework we used Hilbert spaces which have well known applications in quantum computing
                    and Fèjer monotone sequences with applications in convex and combinatorial optimization.
                    The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05969"><b>article</b></a> was published in the 
                    Journal of Nonlinear and Convex Analysis.
